#### 1. Mining company

In my first experience as developer I worked in a local Startup that used to work to several Mining companies that are working in San Juan. 
This project consisted in develop a system where the office workers charge several forms about the Permission requested to the government to work, internal permissions, and the validity of each Permission requested. 
In this project I performed as a Full-Stack Developer, working both in the Backend creating all the logic needed as in the Frontend, applying the design already defined.
