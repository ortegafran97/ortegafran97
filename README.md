#### 1. Mining company Administrative System

In my first experience as developer I worked in a local Startup that used to work to several Mining companies that are working in San Juan. 
This project consisted in develop a system where the office workers charge several forms about the Permission requested to the government to work, internal permissions, and the validity of each Permission requested. 
In this project I performed as a Full-Stack Developer, working both in the Backend creating all the logic needed as in the Frontend, applying the design already defined.

* Work span: 10 months
* Technologies: ASP.NET, HTML & CSS, C#, MVC, Git/Github, SQL (SQL Server)

#### 2. Local E-Commerce

This project was an opportunity to lead a small project to a group of entrepreneurs of San Juan. The main idea was to develop an E-Commerce to all the small bussiness of the city and then expand it to several provinces of Argentina. As the lead of the project I was in charge of both Backend and Frontend, the deployment, part of the design and the meetings with the clients. 
The clients decided to move on to another project and finished the relation with the enterprise and the code was given to them.

* Work span: 8 months
* Technologies: Node, Typescript, React, Heroku, No-SQL (MongoDB)

#### 3. Television and Internet Provider (GlobalLogic - Junior)

After the e-commerce ended I has a span of 6 months to keep learning and developing myself, doing course and experimenting new technologies, one of those was Java Springboot.
After finished a presencial course of Java springBoot I had the opportunity to be referred to Globallogic and get hired. My first project was in an important and global enterprise that distributes Television and Internet. 
Here I had the responsability of maintain 3 Projects, all of them were Java Microservices, 2 of them applied the MVC model and use an Angular front. 
This projects were intercommunicated via Eureka and Config servers to distribute the properties and multiple instances of each service.  

* Work span: 1 year and 6 months
* Technologies: Java SpringBoot, Angular, Java Cloud, Linux Servers, Virtual Machines 

#### 4. Worldwide bank (Globallogic - Semisenior)

Microservices, heavy csv reading and processing, several microservices, config servers, CI/CD, pipelines, jenkins, Sonar, AWS, triggeres, SQL, Kafka

Also inside Globallogic, when I were promoted to Semisenior I was moved to this new project.
This project is the heaviest I been to the moment, exploiting all the things I learned before. 

All the projects are interconnected and are are triggered by an event of EventBridge after a file is dropped in a bucket of AWS S3. This event starts a process where depending the file chooses a path to follow and analyze in a different ways. At the day there are 3 intercommunicated projects, 2 of them received the file and 1 is activated via kafka. 

* Work span: 3 months (still working)
* Technologies: Java Springboot, Spring cloud, AWS (S3, ECS), Virtual Machine (Amazon workspaces), Jira, SQL (Postgres)
