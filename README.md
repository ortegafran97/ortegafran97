## Projects (Newest to oldest)

### 1. Worldwide Bank (GlobalLogic - Semisenior)

> **Role**: Semisenior Developer  
**Work Span**: 4 months (ongoing)  
**Technologies**: Java SpringBoot, Microservices, Spring Cloud, AWS (S3, ECS), Virtual Machines (Amazon Workspaces), Jira, SQL (Postgres), Kafka, Sonar, Unit Testing

Upon my promotion to the position of Semisenior Developer within GlobalLogic, I transitioned to a challenging project that pushed the boundaries of my expertise. This project is the most complex I have been involved in to date, incorporating a wide array of technologies and methodologies.

The project revolves around interconnected microservices that handle heavy CSV reading and processing. These microservices are orchestrated using CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins, Sonar, and are hosted on AWS infrastructure. Key components of the system include AWS S3 for file storage, AWS ECS for container management, and Kafka for event-driven communication.

The system is designed to process files dropped into an AWS S3 bucket, triggering a series of events. Depending on the content and type of file, the system follows specific paths for analysis and processing. As of now, there are three interconnected projects, two of which receive files, while the third is activated via Kafka.

### 2. Television and Internet Provider (GlobalLogic - Junior)

>**Role**: Junior Developer  
**Work Span**: 1 year and 6 months  
**Technologies**: Java SpringBoot, Microservices, Java Cloud, Linux Servers, Virtual Machines, Angular

After completing the e-commerce project, I dedicated 6 months to further expanding my skill set. I embarked on a journey of learning and experimentation, which included a comprehensive course in Java SpringBoot. Subsequently, I had the privilege of being referred to [GlobalLogic](https://www.globallogic.com/latam/) and had the opportunity to join the one of the many teams inside the company.

In my role as a Junior Developer, I was responsible for maintaining three Java Microservices projects. These projects followed the MVC model and incorporated Angular on the frontend. An essential aspect of these projects was their intercommunication through Eureka and Config servers, which facilitated the distribution of properties and the management of multiple instances of each service.

### 3. Local E-Commerce

>**Role**: Full-Stack Developer  
**Work Span**: 8 months  
**Technologies**: Node.js, Typescript, React, Heroku, No-SQL (MongoDB)

I had the privilege of leading a small-scale e-commerce project for a group of entrepreneurs in San Juan. The primary goal of this endeavor was to develop an e-commerce platform that catered to local businesses. As the project lead, I took on a multifaceted role that included backend and frontend development, deployment, partial design work, and client interactions.

During the 8 months of this project, I worked diligently to create a robust and user-friendly e-commerce solution. Although the project ultimately took a different direction and the client decided to part ways, the codebase was provided to them for future use.

### 4. Mining Company Administrative System

>**Role**: Full-Stack Developer  
**Work Span**: 10 months  
**Technologies**: ASP.NET, HTML & CSS, C#, MVC, Git/Github, SQL (SQL Server)

In my first experience as a developer, I had the opportunity to work with a local startup that served several mining companies in the San Juan region. The primary objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive administrative system that streamlined various aspects of mining operations. This system enabled office workers to manage crucial tasks, including the submission of government permits, internal permissions, and the monitoring of permit validity.

As a Full-Stack Developer on this project, I was responsible for crafting the entire software solution alongside my partners. This included creating the backend logic and designing the frontend user interface according to established design guidelines.



### 5. Personal & College Projects

In addition to my professional work, I have actively engaged in various personal and college projects, further enhancing my skills and knowledge. These projects include coursework from renowned platforms like Coursera and Platzi, where I have obtained certificates for completed courses.
